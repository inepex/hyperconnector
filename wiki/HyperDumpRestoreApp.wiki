= What's about corrupt files? = 
  # by application crash the end of a dump file may become corrupt
  # on restart HyperDumper starts a new file, so only the in-memory data will be lost
  # this app supports the corrupt end of dump files, it reads until it can, stores the cells and make a notifycation on the System.out, in most cases it's a stack trace of an IOException or TProtocolException


= Restore data in the order of creation =
*it supports hypertable modifications and deletions without a doubt

Just use the minimal invoke and be patient:
{{{
HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report
}}}


= Problem with deletions (non-in-creation-order restore)=
# *There is not problem with deletions by in-creation-order-restore!*
# when your application deletes a hypertale entity, HyperDumper saves that deletion into a separate dump file
# if you restore the original insertion after you've restored the deletion, the result will contains the entry
# so you have to restore every deletion (from the time of restored insertion until now) after you've restored a time rage of insertions

= Problem with modifications (non-in-creation-order restore) =
# *There is not problem with modifications by in-creation-order-restore!*
# HyperDumper doesn't support the separated dumping of modifications, so you are not able to do it like deletions
# There is no solution for this problem in this app right now

= Restore data starting with the newest =
* both the application and HyperDumper don't support hypertable modifications by non-in-creation-order restore! *Keep it in your mind!*
* but both support deletion, but it's a bit tricky
