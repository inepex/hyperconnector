= About HyperDumpRestoreApp = 

This app is for restoring the dumped data by om.inepex.hyperconnector.dump.HyperDumper into HyperTable.

= Requirements =
  * Java 7
  * all the related java from the pom.xml of hyperconnector (hyperconnector-0.9.5.96.jar libthrift-0.8.0.jar snappy-java-1.0.5-M3.jar hypertable-0.9.5.6.jar slf4j-api-1.6.1.jar)
  * the dump files in the same folder hierarchy, what HyperDumper has created

= The app supports =
  * unlimited dump file size (without extra memory)
  * unlimited dump file count (without extra memory)
  * filter parameters for restore only a month/day/hour
  * corrupt file listing

= The built-in help of the app =

= What's about corrupt files? = 
  # by application crash the end of a dump file may become corrupt
  # on restart HyperDumper starts a new file, so only the in-memory data will be lost
  # this app supports the corrupt end of dump files, it reads until it can, stores the cells and make a notifycation on the System.out, in most cases it's a stack trace of an IOException or TProtocolException


= Restore data in the order of creation =
*it supports hypertable modifications and deletions without a doubt

Just use the minimal invoke and be patient:
{{{
HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report
}}}


= Problem with deletions (non-in-creation-order restore)=
# *There is not problem with deletions by in-creation-order-restore!*
# when your application deletes a hypertale entity, HyperDumper saves that deletion into a separate dump file
# if you restore the original insertion after you've restored the deletion, the result will contains the entry
# so you have to restore every deletion (from the time of restored insertion until now) after you've restored a time rage of insertions

= Problem with modifications (non-in-creation-order restore) =
# *There is not problem with modifications by in-creation-order-restore!*
# HyperDumper doesn't support the separated dumping of modifications, so you are not able to do it like deletions
# There is no solution for this problem in this app right now

= Non-in-creation-order restore (no deletions)=
In case you have a *huge amount of dump files* and want to restore the *last one week*, and after the others, while users can access the data!
(Today is: 25/Dec/2012)

Firstly:
{{{
HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report year=2012 month=12 day=18-25
}}}

And after:
{{{
HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report year=2012 month=12 day=1-18

HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report year=2012 month=11

HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report year=2012 month=10

HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report year=2012 month=9

...

}}}


= Non-in-creation-order restore (with deletions)=
In the previous case, if you have deletions too, that will be a bit more tricky:

Firstly:
{{{
HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report year=2012 month=12 day=18-25 content=BOTH
}}}

Secondly:
{{{
HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report year=2012 month=12 day=1-18 content=BOTH

HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report year=2012 month=12 day=18-25 content=DELETE_ONLY

}}}

Previous month: 
{{{
HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report year=2012 month=11 content=BOTH

HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report year=2012 month=12 content=DELETE_ONLY
}}}

Here starts the deletion pyramid:
{{{
HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report year=2012 month=10 content=BOTH

HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report year=2012 month=11 content=DELETE_ONLY

HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report year=2012 month=12 content=DELETE_ONLY
}}}

And are growing month-by-month:
{{{
HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report year=2012 month=9 content=BOTH

HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report year=2012 month=10 content=DELETE_ONLY

HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report year=2012 month=11 content=DELETE_ONLY

HyperDumpRestoreApp hyperAddress=localhost hyperPort=38080 baseFolder=/backup/hyperDump/ nameSpace=InepexLbs table=Report year=2012 month=12 content=DELETE_ONLY
}}}

Have fun:)
